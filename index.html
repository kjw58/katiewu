      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a PhD Candidate at Stanford University in the <a href="https://eiper.stanford.edu/">Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER)</a> with a minor in <a href="https://cee.stanford.edu/">Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)</a>. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by <a href="https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/people/gretchen-daily">Gretchen Daily</a> (Faculty Director of the Natural Capital Project) and <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/people/abby-king">Abby King</a> (Faculty Director of Our Voice: Citizen Science for Health Equity).</p>
      <p>My research explores how community-driven social interventions and infrastructure development impact community and climate resilience in informal settlements. I work to advance how we operationalize resilience to better inform community-based strategies, policy, and investments that support urban transformation for vulnerable populations. I incorporate participatory methods essential for driving community-led efforts, ensuring a community's deep participation in every step of the iterative analysis, planning, and decision-making processes, in collaboration with multi-sectoral partners and decision-makers. My methodological approach combines advanced data science, including network science and graph neural networks (GNNs), with community-generated, ground-truthed data to redefine how resilience is measured and applied. I use a diverse set of data sources, from citizen science and satellite imagery to private sector and open data, to model the built and natural environment in areas where conventional data is scarce.</p> 
      <p>Prior to Stanford, I studied data science and AI for Product Innovation at Duke University, where I obtained a Master of Engineering Management (MEM). I was a Sustainability Graduate Intern at Lyft, Inc. where I completed and rebuilt their 2020 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory and Report and designed an air quality model forecasting potential health benefits of EV adoption for underserved communities, using ~190 billion data points. I received an M.S. in Medical Science from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a B.S. in Animal Science with Distinction in Research from Cornell University. I'm an <a href="https://stvp.stanford.edu/emerson-consequential-scholars-program/">Emerson Consequential Scholar</a> ('24–'25) with the Stanford Technology Ventures Program (STVP), a Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)</a> ('23–'24), a <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/our-community/dei/community-dei-resources/prospective-students/sdss-deans-graduate-scholars-award">Dean's Graduate Scholar</a> ('22–'23) in the Doerr School of Sustainability, and a <a href="https://cardinalservice.stanford.edu/opportunities/dalai-lama-fellowship-stanford">Stanford Dalai Lama Fellow</a> ('22–'23).</p>
