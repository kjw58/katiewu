      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My research uses large-scale data analysis and machine learning techniques to monitor how infrastructure development impacts human and planetary health in an urban context. My focus is on implementing optimal development opportunities, policies, and strategies prioritizing resource access, equity, human health, and nature. </p> 
      <p>I'm a Dean's Graduate Scholar in the Doerr School of Sustainability and a Stanford Dalai Lama Fellow. Prior to Stanford, I studied data science and AI for Product Innovation at Duke University where I obtained a Master of Engineering Management. I was a Sustainability Graduate Intern at Lyft, Inc. where I completed and rebuilt their 2020 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory and Report in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol and designed an air quality model forecasting potential health benefits of EV adoption for underserved communities. I received an M.S. in Medical Science after transitioning from an MD/PhD program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine to concentrate on human and nature relationships and well-being. </p>
