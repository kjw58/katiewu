      <p>My research focuses on the impact of community-driven social interventions and infrastructure development on community and climate resilience in informal settlements. I'm interested in advancing our operationalization of resilience to better inform community-based strategies, policy, and investment in urban transformation for vulnerable populations. I incorporate participatory methods essential for driving community-led efforts, ensuring a community's ownership of data and deep participation in every step of the iterative analysis, planning, and decision-making processes, alongside multi-sectoral partners and decision-makers. I employ a variety of unconventional data sources, including satellite imagery and citizen-sourced data to model the built and natural environment for geographical locations with limited conventional data. I am co-advised by Gretchen Daily and Abby King.</p> 
      <p>Prior to Stanford, I studied data science and AI for Product Innovation at Duke University where I obtained a Master of Engineering Management. I was a Sustainability Graduate Intern at Lyft, Inc. where I completed and rebuilt their 2020 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory and Report and designed an air quality model forecasting potential health benefits of EV adoption for underserved communities. I received an M.S. in Medical Science from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a B.S. in Animal Science with Distinction in Research from Cornell University. I'm a <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/deans-graduate-scholars-award">Dean's Graduate Scholar</a> in the Doerr School of Sustainability, an <a href="https://stvp.stanford.edu/emerson-consequential-scholars-program/">Emerson Consequential Scholar</a>, a Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)</a>, and a <a href ="https://www.dalailamafellows.org/#main">Stanford Dalai Lama Fellow</a>.</p>
